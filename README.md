# Hunt-The-Wumpus
This is created as you can enter command line argument. So , there are two cases: true and false, so if you write true then you can see the cheat map where you can see the position for every thing in the cave while in false you can just see the position of the player only. Also, in the command line, you have to give the size of cave you want and that should be greater than 4. So your command line should look like:

play_game 4(size of cave) true/false(depending upon you)
